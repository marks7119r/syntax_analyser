# syntax_analyser

A powerful tool for analyzing and validating syntax for code or structured data. Supports custom grammars, detailed error reporting, and multiple output formats. Perfect for developers, educators, and language designers. Ensure your code or data conforms to predefined grammar rules effortlessly!

## Overview

The `syntax_analyser` project provides a robust and user-friendly tool for analyzing and validating the syntax of programming languages and structured data. It leverages a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, enabling users to seamlessly input code, perform lexical analysis (tokenization), parse the code, and generate syntax trees. This process aids in identifying syntax errors and enforcing grammar rules effectively.

## Features

* **Lexical Analysis:**  Efficiently tokenizes input strings into meaningful tokens such as identifiers, numbers, operators, and keywords.
* **Syntax Parsing:**  Accurately parses the tokenized input to generate comprehensive syntax trees, validating code structures against predefined grammar rules.
* **GUI Interface:** Offers an intuitive and interactive interface for users to input code, initiate analysis, and visualize the results in a clear and organized manner.
* **Custom Grammars:**  Provides the flexibility to define and integrate custom grammars, allowing the analysis of various programming languages and data structures.
* **Error Handling:**  Includes a robust error handling mechanism that generates detailed error reports, pinpointing syntax issues with precision and clarity.
* **Multiple Output Formats:** Supports diverse output formats for syntax trees, including JSON and plain text, catering to different user preferences and needs.


## Requirements

* Python 3.x


## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [invalid URL removed]
   cd syntax_analyser
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## How to Use

1. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   python SyntaxAnalyzerGUI.py
   ```

   This will launch the GUI where you can input code for analysis.

2. **Input & Analyze Code:**

   * Enter your code into the provided input field.
   * Click the "Analyze" button to initiate the syntax analysis process.
   * The output area will display the generated syntax tree and any identified errors.

## Example Usage

**Input Code:**

```python
int x = 10 + 5 * (2 - 8);
```

**Output:**

```
Line 1:
{'type': 'Assignment', 'Data Type': 'int', 'left': {'type': 'Identifier', 'name': 'x'}, 'right': {'type': 'BinaryOperation', 'operator': '+', 'left': {'type': 'Number', 'value': '10'}, 'right': {'type': 'BinaryOperation', 'operator': '*', 'left': {'type': 'Number', 'value': '5'}, 'right': {'type': 'BinaryOperation', 'operator': '-', 'left': {'type': 'Number', 'value': '2'}, 'right': {'type': 'Number', 'value': '8'}}}}}
```

## Code Explanation

### SyntaxAnalyzer.py

This file houses the core logic for tokenization and parsing:

* **Tokenization:** Converts the input string into a list of individual tokens using regular expressions. This process breaks down the code into its fundamental building blocks, such as identifiers, keywords, operators, and literals.

* **Parsing:**  This module takes the list of tokens generated by the tokenizer and builds a syntax tree. It validates the code's structure against a set of predefined grammar rules, ensuring that the code adheres to the correct syntax of the language. This process involves analyzing the relationships between tokens and grouping them into hierarchical structures that represent the grammatical constructs of the code.

**Key Components:**

* **Tokenization:**

  ```python
  tokensRegex = [...]  # Define regex patterns for different token types
  
  def tokenize(input_string):
      # Implementation of tokenization logic using regular expression matching and iteration over the input string
      # This function identifies and classifies each token in the input code.
  ```

* **Parsing:**

  ```python
  def parse(tokens):
      # Implementation of parsing logic to generate syntax trees
      # This function recursively analyzes the tokens to build a tree-like representation of the code's syntactic structure.
      # It uses grammar rules to determine the validity of the code and to identify any syntax errors.
  ```

### SyntaxAnalyzerGUI.py

This file is responsible for creating the graphical user interface of the application using the Tkinter library. It handles user interactions and displays the results of the analysis.

* **Code Input:** A text field where users can enter the code they want to analyze.
* **Analyze Button:**  A button that triggers the analysis process when clicked. It calls the `analyze_code` function, which in turn utilizes the `SyntaxAnalyzer` module to perform the analysis.
* **Output Display:** An area where the results of the analysis are displayed. This includes the generated syntax tree and any error messages encountered during the analysis.

**Example of `analyze_code` function:**

```python
def analyze_code():
    code = code_input.get("1.0", tk.END).strip()  # Retrieve code from the input field
    if not code:
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Please enter some code to analyze.")  # Display an error message if no code is entered
        return
    
    # Call the analyzer (tokenizer and parser) from SyntaxAnalyzer.py and display results in the output area
```
